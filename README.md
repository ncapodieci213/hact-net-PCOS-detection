# Hierarchical Graph Representations in Digital Pathology

This repository contains the code to reproduce results of the [Hierarchical Graph Representations in Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11057.pdf) paper. 

The code mostly relies on the [`histocartography`](https://github.com/histocartography/histocartography) library, a python-based package for modeling and learning with graphs of pathology images. 

All the experiments are based on the BRACS dataset. The data needs to be downloaded separately (see Installation steps).

## Installation 

### Cloning and handling dependencies 

Clone the repo:

```
# git clone https://github.com/histocartography/hact-net.git && cd hact-net
git clone https://github.com/ncapodieci213/hact-net-PCOS-detection.git && cd hact-net
```

Create a conda environment and activate it:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate hactnet
```

### Downloading the BRACS dataset 

BRACS is a dataset of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) histopathological images for automated detection/classification of breast tumors. BRACS includes >4k tumor regions-of-interest labeled in 7 categories (Normal, Benign, UDH, ADH, FEA, DCIS, Invasive). 

In order to download the BRACS dataset, you need to create an account [there](https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/). Then, go to `Data Collection`, `Download`, and hit the `Regions of Interest Set` button to access the data. Download the `previous_version` data. The data are stored on an FTP server. 

## Running the code 

The proposed HACT-Net architecture operates on a HieArchical Cell-to-Tissue representation that is further processed by a Graph Neural Network. Running HACT-Net requires 2 steps:

### Step 1: HieArchical Cell-to-Tissue (HACT) generation 

The HACT representation can be generated for the `train` set by running: 

```
cd core
python generate_hact_graphs.py --image_path <PATH-TO-BRACS>/BRACS/train/ --save_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data
```

For generating HACT on the `test` and `val` set, simply replace the `image_path` by `<PATH-TO-BRACS>/BRACS/val/` or `<PATH-TO-BRACS>/BRACS/test/`. 

The script will automatically create three directories containing for each image:
- a cell graph as a `.bin` file
- a tissue graph as a `.bin` file
- an assignment matrix as an `.h5` file

After the generation of HACT graphs on the whole BRACS set, the `hact-net-data` dir should look like:

```
hact-net-data
|
|__ cell_graphs 
    |
    |__ train
    |
    |__ test
    |
    |__ val
|
|__ tissue_graphs
    |
    |__ train
    |
    |__ test
    |
    |__ val
|
|__ assignment_matrices 
    |
    |__ train
    |
    |__ test
    |
    |__ val
```

### Step 2: Training HACTNet 

We provide the option to train 3 types of models, namely a Cell Graph model, Tissue Graph model and HACTNet model. 


Training HACTNet as:

```
python train.py --cg_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data/cell_graphs/ --tg_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data/tissue_graphs/ --assign_mat_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data/assignment_matrices/  --config_fpath ../data/config/hact_bracs_hactnet_7_classes_pna.yml -b 8 --in_ram --epochs 60 -l 0.0005 
```


Training a Cell Graph model as:

```
python train.py --cg_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data/cell_graphs/ --config_fpath ../data/config/cg_bracs_cggnn_7_classes_pna.yml -b 8 --in_ram --epochs 60 -l 0.0005 

```

Training a Tissue Graph model as:

```
python train.py --tg_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data/tissue_graphs/ --config_fpath ../data/config/tg_bracs_tggnn_7_classes_pna.yml -b 8 --in_ram --epochs 60 -l 0.0005 

```

Usage is:

```
usage: train.py [-h] [--cg_path CG_PATH] [--tg_path TG_PATH]
                [--assign_mat_path ASSIGN_MAT_PATH] [-conf CONFIG_FPATH]
                [--model_path MODEL_PATH] [--in_ram] [-b BATCH_SIZE]
                [--epochs EPOCHS] [-l LEARNING_RATE] [--out_path OUT_PATH]
                [--logger LOGGER]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --cg_path CG_PATH     path to the cell graphs.
  --tg_path TG_PATH     path to tissue graphs.
  --assign_mat_path ASSIGN_MAT_PATH
                        path to the assignment matrices.
  -conf CONFIG_FPATH, --config_fpath CONFIG_FPATH
                        path to the config file.
  --model_path MODEL_PATH
                        path to where the model is saved.
  --in_ram              if the data should be stored in RAM.
  -b BATCH_SIZE, --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        batch size.
  --epochs EPOCHS       epochs.
  -l LEARNING_RATE, --learning_rate LEARNING_RATE
                        learning rate.
  --out_path OUT_PATH   path to where the output data are saved (currently
                        only for the interpretability).
  --logger LOGGER       Logger type. Options are "mlflow" or "none"
```

The output of this script will be a directory containing three models corresponding to the best validation loss, validation accuracy and weighted F1-score. 

### (Step 3: Inference on HACTNet)

We also provide a script for running inference with the option to use a pretrained model.

For instance, running inference with a pretrained HACTNet model: 

```
python inference.py --cg_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data/cell_graphs/ --tg_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data/tissue_graphs/ --assign_mat_path <SOME-SAVE-PATH>/hact-net-data/assignment_matrices/  --config_fpath ../data/config/hact_bracs_hactnet_7_classes_pna.yml --pretrained
```

We provide 3 pretrained checkpoints performing as:

| Model | Accuracy | Weighted F1-score |
| ----- |:--------:|:-----------------:|
| Cell Graph Model   | 58.1 | 56.7 |
| Tissue Graph Model | 58.6 | 57.8 |
| HACTNet Model      | 61.7   | 61.5 |
